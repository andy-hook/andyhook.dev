            Great user experience is at the core of everything I do, I believe
            that close collaboration between design, user research and front-end
            engineering leads to a superior customer experience within digital
            products.

            As a specialist in modular design systems and component libraries, I
            work to bridge the gap between design and engineering disiplines and
            am a catalyst for fast, iterative design processes within agile
            product teams. My technical experience spans a wealth of front-end
            technologies ranging from modern SPA frameworks to run-time
            performance profiling and testing. Some of my preferred tools
            include React, TypeScript, Styled Components and Jest.
